# Button Builder #

This repository contains the source code for the Button Builder demo!  This demo was primary constructed to show how the [Interaction Engine][] and the [Graphic Renderer][] can work together.  

At a high level, this demo shows off:
 - `Graphical optimizations` - Through the use of the Graphic Renderer, the scene can be rendered in just a few draw calls!  
 - `Intuitive interaction` - The Interaction Engine allows all of the interface elements to respond in an intuitive physical way.
 - `Curved spaces` - Due to the tight integration of curved spaces into both the Graphic Renderer and the Interaction Engine, the entire interface can be trivially warped into a curved space, and everything still works as you indend!
